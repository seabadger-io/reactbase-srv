Firestore rules and cloud functions for reactbase-ui

These are the Firebase/firestore rules and cloud functions which
I used in relation to [https://github.com/seabadger-io/reactbase-ui](https://github.com/seabadger-io/reactbase-ui)

You can deploy these rules and functions into your Firebase project,
just note, that a full deployment overwrites every existing rule and
function in the project. So if it's not a new project, make sure you
merge these with your existing rules/functions/etc.
